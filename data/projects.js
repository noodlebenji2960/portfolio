The game not only tests strategic thinking but also delights with visually appealing animations that breathe life into a classic game. What is the minMax algo? The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player, zero-sum games, such as chess or tic-tac-toe. The primary objective of Minimax is to find the optimal strategy for a player, considering all possible moves and their potential outcomes. The algorithm operates on a recursive tree-like structure, where nodes represent different game states, and edges represent possible moves. Minimax alternates between maximizing and minimizing players, evaluating each potential move based on a scoring system. The algorithm assumes that both players make optimal decisions, aiming to minimize the possible loss for the worst-case scenario and maximize potential gain for the best-case scenario. Despite its simplicity, Minimax provides a robust framework for decision-making in adversarial games, ensuring strategic depth and competitive gameplay.`,
